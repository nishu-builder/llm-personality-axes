Here's a brief explanation from a scientific perspective:\n\nSunlight is composed of different colors, each of which is a different wavelength of light. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the light in all directions. However, blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in shorter, smaller waves. This means that blue light is more easily scattered by the gases in the atmosphere.\n\nAs a result, when you look up at the sky, you see a predominance of blue light, which is why the sky appears blue.
